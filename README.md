some ideas on procedural tree generation in C
* trees grow new segments from branch tips
* segments tend to grow upwards
* existing segments grow radially outward
* trees often have a central leader (trunk) up to some point in their lifetime

* uses glfw for window framework https://www.glfw.org/
* uses sokol for rendering https://github.com/floooh/sokol
* uses ctl for comtainers https://rurban.github.io/ctl/
* uses cglm for math https://github.com/recp/cglm
* uses stb_image for image loading https://github.com/nothings/stb
